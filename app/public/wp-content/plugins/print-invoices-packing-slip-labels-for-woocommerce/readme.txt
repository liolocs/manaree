== Introduction ==

WooCommerce Print Invoice, Packing Slip, Delivery Note and Shipping Label for WooCommerce plugin helps you generate PDF invoices, packing lists / packing slips, delivery notes, dispatch labels and shipping labels from the WooCommerce orders page. WooCommerce, by default, doesn't allow you to print any of these documents from your orders page. 

Beyond invoices and packing slips, the plugin makes it easy to create and print WooCommerce delivery notes that include essential details such as order items, customer information and shipping addresses. These documents help ensure accurate and smooth order handovers.

This free WooCommerce invoice plugin helps streamline your WordPress shipping and order fulfillment processes.

== Why Are WooCommerce Invoice PDFs and Packing Lists Important? ==

Including an invoice PDF and packing list with your shipped package is not just a good practice - it’s essential. These documents confirm the contents of the package, provide your contact information, and include critical purchase details, ensuring a smooth transaction for both you and your customer.

For international sales, many countries require invoices as part of their standard shipping regulations. These invoices must include key order details, such as your company name and address, the customer’s billing address, and a detailed breakdown of the order, including taxes and totals.

Beyond compliance, these documents enhance customer experience by adding a human touch and serving as an additional communication channel between you and your buyer.
